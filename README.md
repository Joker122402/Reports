Welcome to my Github Repository

I spend a lot of my free time completing haacking challenges on websites such as Tryhackme.com and hackthebox.eu. 

As a means of practice for what I hope will be my future career, I create a writeup of every challenge that i complete in the form of a Professional Penetration Test Report. This is for me to practice and for you to learn from. 
(Edit: My writeups are now located on my blog: https://joker122402.home.blog/).

If there is a report here that shares content from your website that you do not want shared, it is likely here due to me not knowing that it cant be shared, or me going to far in depth in my explanations. Please by all means let me know and i will gladly take said report down. 

If anyone has any comments on how to make my reports better, please by all means let me know.

Happy Hacking,
